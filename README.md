# About this Project

This is a ping pong score keeper made with Javascript, that uses the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS Framework. I used this to learn about working with DOM events. Nothing fancy, just trying to make a simple thing work well and look clean!

This was quick and easy to make and was my first time exploring the use of Bulma.
